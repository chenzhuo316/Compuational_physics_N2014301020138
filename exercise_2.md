### Consider again a decay problem with two type of nuclei A ande B, but now suppose that nuclei of type A decay into ones of type B.While nuclei of type B decay into ones of type A.Strictly speaking,this is not a decay process,since it is possible for the type B nuclei to turn back into type A nuclei. A better analogy would be a reasonance in which a system can tunnel or move back and forth between two states A and B which have equal energies. The corresponding rate equations are ![]() where for simplicity we have assumed that two types of dacay are characterized by the same time constant,![]().Solve this system of equations for the numbers of nuclei ,Na and Nb,as functions of time.Consider different initial conditions ,such as Na=100,Nb=100,etc,and take ![]()=1s.Show that your numerical results are consistent with the idea that the system reaches a steady state in which Na and Nb are constant.In such a steady state,the time derivatives dNa/dt and dNb/dt should vanish.Â
