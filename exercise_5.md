###question<br>
In constructing the Poincaré section in Figure 3.9 we plotted points only at times that were in phase with the drive force; that is, at times t=2πn/Ωd , where n is an integer. At these values of t the driving force passed through zero [see(3.18)]. However, we could jusi as easily have chosen to make the plot at times corresponding to a maximum of the drive force, or at times π/4 out-of-phase with this force, etc. Construct the Poincaré sections for these cases and compare them with Figure 3.9.
